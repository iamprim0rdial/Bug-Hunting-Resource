9. **HTTP Response Splitting**
    - Manipulating HTTP responses to inject malicious data into response headers.
10. **Lack of Logging and Monitoring**
    - Inadequate logging or monitoring that allows attackers to act without detection.
11. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
    - Overloading the application’s resources, rendering it unavailable.
12. **Broken Access Control**
    - Insufficient checks on who can access what within an application, leading to privilege escalation.
13. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    - Attackers sending malicious requests from the server itself, often leading to data exfiltration or server compromise.
14. **Improper Asset Management**
    - Leaving sensitive assets, such as old code, debug files, or outdated APIs, exposed to attackers.
15. **Race Conditions**
    - Exploiting timing issues where an attacker manipulates the sequence of events in the application to cause unintended behavior.

### Advanced Level Vulnerabilities:

1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
    - Exploiting the application to run arbitrary code on the server.
2. **Buffer Overflow**
    - Attacking software by sending more data to a buffer than it can handle, leading to overwriting memory.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS) - Application Layer**
    - Targeting specific application functions or services to render them unresponsive.
4. **Privilege Escalation**
    - Exploiting weak access controls to gain higher-level privileges (e.g., admin access).
5. **Server-Side JavaScript Injection**
    - Injecting malicious JavaScript on the server side that gets executed on the client side.
6. **Directory Indexing**
    - Leaving server directories accessible to attackers, revealing sensitive files and directories.
7. **Broken Cryptography**
    - Using weak encryption methods that can be easily bypassed or cracked.
8. **Authentication Bypass**
    - Exploiting flaws in the authentication system to impersonate users or gain unauthorized access.
9. **Insufficient Input Validation**
    - Failing to properly validate user inputs, allowing attackers to inject malicious data.
10. **HTTP Request Smuggling**
    - Manipulating HTTP requests to bypass security mechanisms and inject malicious data.
11. **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU)**
    - A vulnerability where data is checked for validity, but the data is modified before it’s used, leading to potential exploits.
12. **Subdomain Takeover**
    - Taking control of an unused or misconfigured subdomain.
13. **Improper Session Management**
    - Attacker hijacking or manipulating user sessions.
14. **Clickjacking with iFrames**
    - Using transparent or invisible frames to deceive the user into clicking on malicious content.
15. **Web Shells**
    - Uploading malicious scripts to web servers that provide attackers with control over the server.
16. **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking**
    - Attacker hijacks a WebSocket connection to gain access to sensitive data or inject malicious commands.
17. **Untrusted Deserialization**
    - Exploiting deserialization to execute arbitrary code or manipulate application state.
18. **Insecure API Endpoints**
    - Exposing sensitive data through poorly secured or unprotected API endpoints.
19. **Credential Stuffing**

20. **Authorization Bypass via URL Manipulation**
    - Exploiting vulnerable endpoints by manipulating URL parameters to bypass authorization checks.
21. **Cross-Protocol Attacks**
    - Exploiting protocol mismatches between web and non-web protocols to bypass security protections.
22. **Sensitive Data in URLs**
    - Including sensitive data like tokens or session IDs in URLs, making them vulnerable to leakage or interception.
23. **Memory Corruption**
    - Corrupting the memory of an application to execute arbitrary code or cause unexpected behaviors.
24. **Click Fraud via Bots**

25. **Timing Attacks**
    - Analyzing time differences in responses to guess sensitive data like passwords or encryption keys.
26. **Invisible Field Manipulation**
    - Manipulating hidden fields in forms to exploit the application’s logic.
27. **Use of Deprecated Libraries**
    - Leveraging known security vulnerabilities in outdated or deprecated third-party libraries or frameworks.

    - Injecting unsafe JavaScript into applications to execute malicious code.
29. **Lack of Proper Input Sanitization**

# Vulnerability Name üêûüîçüìù

### - Improper Input Validation
Occurs when an application does not properly validate user inputs, allowing malicious data to be processed.  
**Example**: A form allows a user to input a phone number without checking if it contains letters or special characters, which could lead to SQL injection.

### - Path Traversal
Allows attackers to access files or directories that are outside the intended directory, potentially exposing sensitive files.  
**Example**: A file upload function allows a user to upload files with paths like `../../../etc/passwd`, which could expose system files.

### - Command Injection
Occurs when an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, often leading to full server compromise.  
**Example**: A search bar that executes a command to search files on the server might allow an attacker to input `; rm -rf /`, deleting important data.

### - OS Command Injection
A type of command injection where the attacker injects OS-level commands that the application executes.  
**Example**: A web application that allows users to input a hostname and then runs `ping <user_input>` without validation, enabling attackers to run any system command.

### - Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into content that is then executed by the browser of a user visiting the site.  
  - **Reflected XSS**: Malicious script is reflected off the web server and executed in the user's browser.  
  **Example**: A search function that reflects user input in the page's content allows an attacker to inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which runs when a user visits the page.

  - **Stored XSS**: Malicious script is stored on the web server and executed whenever the user accesses the affected page.  
  **Example**: A comment section that does not sanitize user input allows an attacker to post `<script>maliciousCode()</script>`, which runs every time the comment is viewed.

  - **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability is in the client-side script rather than the server-side code.  
  **Example**: A JavaScript application that uses `document.location.hash` without sanitizing the input can be exploited by an attacker who modifies the URL hash with a malicious script.

### - SQL Injection
Occurs when an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the database.  
  - **Classic SQL Injection**: Injecting SQL code directly into an input field or URL.  
  **Example**: In a login form, if a user enters `admin' OR 1=1--`, it bypasses authentication and grants access to unauthorized users.

  - **Blind SQL Injection**: Attacker asks the server true or false questions and determines if their queries are correct based on the responses.  
  **Example**: An attacker inputs `1' AND 1=1--` and checks if the application responds differently to know if the query was executed successfully.

  - **Union-based SQL Injection**: Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of a query with other queries.  
  **Example**: An attacker might input `1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--` to retrieve usernames and passwords from the database.

### - LDAP Injection
Allows an attacker to manipulate LDAP queries to gain unauthorized access or disclose information from a directory service.  
**Example**: An application that takes user input to search an LDAP directory might allow an attacker to input `*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*`, which could return all user records.

### - Code Injection
Involves injecting malicious code into an application that is then executed by the server or application.  
**Example**: A text box that takes user input and runs it as a PHP command without sanitization could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

### - HTTP Response Splitting
Occurs when an attacker can inject headers into HTTP responses, often leading to cache poisoning or redirection attacks.  
**Example**: An attacker enters a malicious input like `\r\nSet-Cookie: user=evil` in a form, leading to multiple HTTP headers being set, which could be exploited for further attacks.

### - Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers
Involves the improper handling of carriage return or line feed characters in HTTP headers, which can lead to response splitting or log injection.  
**Example**: A web application that doesn't sanitize input allows an attacker to insert CRLF (`\r\n`) sequences, causing a new header or body to be injected.

### - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input
Happens when data is copied into a buffer without checking the size, potentially leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.  
**Example**: An application copies user input into a buffer without checking if it exceeds the buffer's size, causing an overflow that could be exploited to execute malicious code.

### - Buffer Overread
Occurs when an application reads more data than allocated in memory, potentially exposing sensitive information.  
**Example**: A program reads a 10-byte string from memory but incorrectly accesses 20 bytes, potentially leaking sensitive data beyond the allocated space.

### - Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
Involves errors in calculating buffer size, which can result in buffer overflows or corruption.  
**Example**: A program that assumes the buffer size is always the same size as the user input may lead to overflow if larger data is provided.

### - Uncontrolled Format String
Occurs when user input is passed directly to functions that interpret format strings, allowing attackers to manipulate memory.  
**Example**: If an application passes user input directly into a `printf` function, an attacker can provide input like `%x%x%x`, potentially revealing stack data.

### - Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Occurs when a value exceeds its maximum limit, causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.  
**Example**: If a program adds two large numbers without checking for overflow, the result might wrap around to a negative number, leading to incorrect behavior.

### - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Occurs when sensitive information (like passwords, personal data) is exposed to users who shouldn't have access to it.  
**Example**: A user may be able to view another user‚Äôs profile data due to improper access control on the application.

### - Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Happens when detailed error messages reveal information that attackers can exploit.  
**Example**: A web application that outputs the full stack trace, including file paths and database queries, can give attackers useful information about the system.

### - Intentional Information Exposure
Occurs when information is intentionally exposed to unauthorized parties, either through misconfiguration or malicious intent.  
**Example**: An admin might accidentally share sensitive data in a public forum or Slack channel.

### - Information Exposure Through Debug Information
Occurs when debug information (such as stack traces) is unintentionally exposed, providing attackers with valuable insight into system internals.  
**Example**: A web application accidentally reveals a detailed error message with file paths and query strings in the response body.

### - Improper Handling of Extra Parameters
Occurs when an application doesn't properly handle extra or unexpected input parameters, which may be exploited.  
**Example**: A web application might pass additional parameters to a URL that bypasses access control, granting unauthorized access.

### - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
When an application runs with higher privileges than needed, increasing the risk if compromised.  
**Example**: A web server running with root privileges gives attackers access to the entire system if they exploit a vulnerability.

### - Improper Access Control
Occurs when unauthorized users can access resources they shouldn't, due to misconfigured access control.  
**Example**: A URL might allow users to access another user's order details by modifying the URL, even though they shouldn‚Äôt have permission.

### - Missing Authentication for Critical Function
When critical functions lack proper authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access.  
**Example**: A payment gateway may allow any user to initiate a transaction without requiring user authentication.

### - Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Failure to limit the number of authentication attempts, making brute force attacks easier.  
**Example**: A login page does not lock an account after 5 failed login attempts, enabling an attacker to keep trying passwords until they guess correctly.

### - Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Sensitive data is not encrypted, exposing it to potential interception or unauthorized access.  
**Example**: A website submits user passwords to the server in plain text without encryption, making them vulnerable to interception.

### - Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Sensitive information is stored in plain text, increasing the risk if the storage is compromised.  
**Example**: A database storing user passwords in plain text rather than hashed values, allowing attackers to read passwords if they access the database.

### - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Sensitive data transmitted in clear text over the network, making it susceptible to interception.  
**Example**: A form on a website that submits credit card numbers without using HTTPS, allowing an attacker to intercept the data.

### - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Occurs when an attacker tricks a user into performing unwanted actions on a web application where they are authenticated.  
**Example**: An attacker crafts a malicious request to change a user's email address and tricks the user into clicking a link while logged in.

### - Race Condition
Occurs when the system's behavior depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events, often leading to vulnerabilities.  
  - **Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition**: A specific type of race condition where a resource's state is checked and then used, but the state can change in between.  
  **Example**: An attacker changes the file content between the time it's checked and when it is used by the application, leading to unexpected behavior.

### - Session Fixation
Occurs when an attacker can set a user's session identifier, allowing them to hijack the session.  
**Example**: An attacker sends a link with a specific session ID, and when the user logs in, they are assigned the attacker‚Äôs session.

### - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Occurs when an application does not properly control the use of resources, potentially leading to denial of service.  
**Example**: An application fails to limit the number of requests a user can make, allowing an attacker to flood the system and crash it.

### - Use After Free
Occurs when an application continues to use memory after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or vulnerabilities.  
**Example**: An application accesses a piece of memory that has been freed, potentially leading to crashes or data corruption.

### - Untrusted Search Path
Occurs when an application uses an insecure search path, allowing attackers to manipulate or substitute files.  
**Example**: An application looks for dynamic libraries in a directory where an attacker can place malicious files to be loaded by the application.

### - Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Occurs when an application allows users to upload potentially dangerous files, such as executable code.  
**Example**: A website that lets users upload images but does not check file extensions might allow an attacker to upload a PHP shell script instead.

### - External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
When an application assumes a web parameter is unchangeable, but an attacker can modify it to exploit the system.  
**Example**: A web application uses a parameter like `session_id` in URLs and an attacker can modify it to hijack another user's session.

### - NULL Pointer Dereference
Occurs when a program attempts to dereference a null pointer, causing a crash or undefined behavior.  
**Example**: A program attempts to access a memory address that hasn‚Äôt been initialized yet, causing the application to crash.

### - Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Occurs when downloaded code is not verified, allowing attackers to deliver malicious code.  
**Example**: A software update is downloaded and executed without verifying its checksum, allowing an attacker to inject malware.

### - Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Happens when untrusted data is deserialized, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause unexpected behavior.  
**Example**: A server deserializes data from an untrusted source and executes malicious code embedded in the input.

### - Weak Password Requirements
Occurs when an application allows weak or easily guessable passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.  
**Example**: A login form accepts passwords like `123456`, which can be easily guessed by attackers using brute-force methods.

### - Insufficiently Protected Credentials
When credentials are not adequately protected, such as using weak encryption or storing them in plain text.  
**Example**: An application stores user credentials in a plain text file on the server, making it easy for attackers to retrieve them.

### - URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (‚ÄòOpen Redirect‚Äô)
Occurs when an attacker can trick the application into redirecting a user to a malicious site.  
**Example**: An attacker uses a legitimate-looking link that redirects users to a phishing site once they click.

### - Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE)
Occurs when an XML parser processes external entities, allowing an attacker to access internal files or services.  
**Example**: An XML parser that reads user-uploaded files might be tricked into accessing sensitive system files via an external entity.

### - Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without ‚ÄòSecure‚Äô Attribute
Cookies are transmitted over an insecure channel, potentially allowing attackers to intercept them.  
**Example**: An attacker intercepts a session cookie because it was transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

### - Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Occurs when incorrect permissions are set on critical resources, potentially allowing unauthorized access.  
**Example**: A file containing sensitive user information might have overly permissive access controls, allowing unauthorized users to read or modify it.

### - Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
When passwords or sensitive data are hashed without adding a salt, making it easier for attackers to use precomputed hash attacks.  
**Example**: An attacker uses a precomputed rainbow table to reverse-engineer passwords because the hash algorithm used no salt.

### - Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Hard-coded credentials within the application code, which can easily be discovered and exploited.  
**Example**: A developer hardcodes a password into an application source code, and an attacker can extract it from the binary or repository.

### - Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
When security decisions are made based on untrusted input, allowing attackers to bypass security checks.  
**Example**: An application uses a query parameter `is_admin=true` to check user permissions, and an attacker simply changes the parameter value.

### - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Occurs when an attacker can make the server send requests to an internal or unauthorized resource.  
**Example**: An attacker manipulates a web application that fetches URLs, causing it to make requests to internal services or unauthorized servers.

# Vulnerability Name üêûüîçüìù

### - Improper Input Validation
Occurs when an application does not properly validate user inputs, allowing malicious data to be processed.

### - Path Traversal
Allows attackers to access files or directories that are outside the intended directory, potentially exposing sensitive files.

### - Command Injection
Occurs when an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, often leading to full server compromise.

### - OS Command Injection
A type of command injection where the attacker injects OS-level commands that the application executes.

### - Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into content that is then executed by the browser of a user visiting the site.
  - **Reflected XSS**: Malicious script is reflected off the web server and executed in the user's browser.
  - **Stored XSS**: Malicious script is stored on the web server and executed whenever the user accesses the affected page.
  - **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability is in the client-side script rather than the server-side code.

### - SQL Injection
Occurs when an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the database.
  - **Classic SQL Injection**: Injecting SQL code directly into an input field or URL.
  - **Blind SQL Injection**: Attacker asks the server true or false questions and determines if their queries are correct based on the responses.
  - **Union-based SQL Injection**: Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of a query with other queries.

### - LDAP Injection
Allows an attacker to manipulate LDAP queries to gain unauthorized access or disclose information from a directory service.

### - Code Injection
Involves injecting malicious code into an application that is then executed by the server or application.

### - HTTP Response Splitting
Occurs when an attacker can inject headers into HTTP responses, often leading to cache poisoning or redirection attacks.

### - Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers
Involves the improper handling of carriage return or line feed characters in HTTP headers, which can lead to response splitting or log injection.

### - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input
Happens when data is copied into a buffer without checking the size, potentially leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

### - Buffer Overread
Occurs when an application reads more data than allocated in memory, potentially exposing sensitive information.

### - Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
Involves errors in calculating buffer size, which can result in buffer overflows or corruption.

### - Uncontrolled Format String
Occurs when user input is passed directly to functions that interpret format strings, allowing attackers to manipulate memory.

### - Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Occurs when a value exceeds its maximum limit, causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

### - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Occurs when sensitive information (like passwords, personal data) is exposed to users who shouldn't have access to it.

### - Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Happens when detailed error messages reveal information that attackers can exploit.

### - Intentional Information Exposure
Occurs when information is intentionally exposed to unauthorized parties, either through misconfiguration or malicious intent.

### - Information Exposure Through Debug Information
Occurs when debug information (such as stack traces) is unintentionally exposed, providing attackers with valuable insight into system internals.

### - Improper Handling of Extra Parameters
Occurs when an application doesn't properly handle extra or unexpected input parameters, which may be exploited.

### - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
When an application runs with higher privileges than needed, increasing the risk if compromised.

### - Improper Access Control
Occurs when unauthorized users can access resources they shouldn't, due to misconfigured access control.

### - Missing Authentication for Critical Function
When critical functions lack proper authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

### - Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Failure to limit the number of authentication attempts, making brute force attacks easier.

### - Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Sensitive data is not encrypted, exposing it to potential interception or unauthorized access.

### - Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Sensitive information is stored in plain text, increasing the risk if the storage is compromised.

### - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Sensitive data transmitted in clear text over the network, making it susceptible to interception.

### - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Occurs when an attacker tricks a user into performing unwanted actions on a web application where they are authenticated.

### - Race Condition
Occurs when the system's behavior depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events, often leading to vulnerabilities.
  - **Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition**: A specific type of race condition where a resource's state is checked and then used, but the state can change in between.

### - Session Fixation
Occurs when an attacker can set a user's session identifier, allowing them to hijack the session.

### - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Occurs when an application does not properly control the use of resources, potentially leading to denial of service.

### - Use After Free
Occurs when an application continues to use memory after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or vulnerabilities.

### - Untrusted Search Path
Occurs when an application uses an insecure search path, allowing attackers to manipulate or substitute files.

### - Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Occurs when an application allows users to upload potentially dangerous files, such as executable code.

### - External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
When an application assumes a web parameter is unchangeable, but an attacker can modify it to exploit the system.

### - NULL Pointer Dereference
Occurs when a program attempts to dereference a null pointer, causing a crash or undefined behavior.

### - Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Occurs when downloaded code is not verified, allowing attackers to deliver malicious code.

### - Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Happens when untrusted data is deserialized, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause unexpected behavior.

### - Weak Password Requirements
Occurs when an application allows weak or easily guessable passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

### - Insufficiently Protected Credentials
When credentials are not adequately protected, such as using weak encryption or storing them in plain text.

### - URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (‚ÄòOpen Redirect‚Äô)
Occurs when an attacker can trick the application into redirecting a user to a malicious site.

### - Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE)
Occurs when an XML parser processes external entities, allowing an attacker to access internal files or services.

### - Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without ‚ÄòSecure‚Äô Attribute
Cookies are transmitted over an insecure channel, potentially allowing attackers to intercept them.

### - Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Occurs when incorrect permissions are set on critical resources, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

### - Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
When passwords or sensitive data are hashed without adding a salt, making it easier for attackers to use precomputed hash attacks.

### - Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Hard-coded credentials within the application code, which can easily be discovered and exploited.

### - Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
When security decisions are made based on untrusted input, allowing attackers to bypass security checks.

### - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Occurs when an attacker can make the server send requests to an internal or unauthorized resource.

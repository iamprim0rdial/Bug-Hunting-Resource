Choose the target .
Check In-scope Domain
Search about Target Work & there assets.
**Conduct Reconnaissance**
     (Gather as much information as possible about the target system.)
    1. Enumerate the possible and alive sub , child or siblings domains .
    2. Technical details (server type, software versions, dependencies)
    3. Network configuration (firewalls, routing tables, DNS)
    4. Publicly available information (whois, SSL/TLS certificates, source code)
    5. Social media and other online presence
Give time and try to test on all sub-domains.
**Map the attack surface.** (Greater the collected information, helps to make large attack surface area, which lead to high chance of success attack. )
**Identify potential entry points**  
    1. Unprotected network services (FTP, SSH, Telnet, etc.)
Automate the testing by checking every entry point.
Then Try Manual Testing on every entry point.
Recheck, Revisit the vulnerability check point .
